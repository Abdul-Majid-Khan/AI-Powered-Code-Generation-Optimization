# AI-Powered-Code-Generation-Optimization
# ðŸ§  Code Generation & Error Explanation with Transformers

This project demonstrates an intelligent assistant for **code generation**, **autocompletion**, and **error explanation** using a transformer-based language model from the Hugging Face library. It uses the [`Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono`](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono) model.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Natural language prompt to Python code generation  
- âœ… Code autocompletion for partially written functions  
- âœ… Common error detection and explanation with suggestions  

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers (HuggingFace)

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install torch transformers
